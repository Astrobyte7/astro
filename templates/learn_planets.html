        <h1>Planets in Our Solar System</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Planets are celestial objects that orbit stars, and in our solar system, they primarily orbit the Sun. Planets are characterized by several key features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Orbital Motion:</strong> Planets follow an elliptical or nearly circular path as they revolve around a star, such as the Sun. This motion is governed by the gravitational force between the planet and the star.</li>
            <li><strong>Spherical Shape:</strong> Planets are generally spherical in shape due to the force of gravity pulling their matter inward. This characteristic distinguishes them from smaller celestial bodies like asteroids and comets, which often have irregular shapes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cleared Their Orbit:</strong> Planets have cleared their orbital paths of other debris and objects, meaning they have sufficient mass and gravitational influence to dominate their orbits and prevent other objects from sharing the same path.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üåçTypes of Planets</h2>
        <p>In our solar system, there are two main categories of planets:</p>
        <h3>Terrestrial Planets (Inner Planets)</h3>
        <p>These planets are called terrestrial because they are similar in composition to Earth, primarily composed of rocks and metals. They are located closer to the Sun than the gas giants.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mercury:</strong> The closest planet to the Sun, with a very thin atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Venus:</strong> Known for its thick, toxic atmosphere and extreme surface temperatures.</li>
            <li><strong>Earth:</strong> Our home planet, unique in its ability to support life, with a diverse ecosystem and moderate temperatures.</li>
            <li><strong>Mars:</strong> Often referred to as the "Red Planet," known for its thin atmosphere and potential for future human exploration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ü™êGas Giant Planets (Outer Planets)</h3>
        <p>Gas giants are significantly larger than terrestrial planets and are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, similar to the composition of the Sun.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Jupiter:</strong> The largest planet in our solar system, known for its massive size, strong magnetic field, and numerous moons.</li>
            <li><strong>Saturn:</strong> Known for its spectacular ring system and a diverse array of moons.</li>
            <li><strong>Uranus:</strong> A planet that rotates on its side and has a unique bluish color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Neptune:</strong> The farthest known planet in our solar system, with a dynamic atmosphere and a system of rings and moons.</li>
        </ul>

        
        <p>It's worth noting that there are other celestial objects in our solar system, such as dwarf planets (e.g., Pluto), which are similar in some ways to planets but have not "cleared their orbits" according to the current definition established by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Additionally, there are exoplanets, which are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system and come in a wide variety of types and sizes.</p>

            <p><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, situated at an average distance of about 57.9 million kilometers (36 million miles).</p>
            <p><strong>Size:</strong> It is the smallest planet in the solar system, with a diameter of approximately 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles).</p>
            <p><strong>Surface:</strong> Mercury's surface is heavily cratered due to countless impacts from space debris. It also has extensive plains and cliffs.</p>
            <p><strong>Temperature Extremes:</strong> Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations, with scorching daytime highs of around 430¬∞C (800¬∞F) and frigid nighttime lows of -180¬∞C (-290¬∞F).</p>
            <p><strong>Lack of Atmosphere:</strong> Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, primarily composed of trace amounts of helium and hydrogen, making it unable to support human life.</p>
