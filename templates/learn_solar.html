    <h1>Introduction to the Solar System</h1>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The solar system is a vast collection of celestial objects bound together by gravity, all of which orbit the central star, the Sun. It consists of various types of objects, primarily the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other smaller bodies.</p>

    <h2>üåüThe Sun:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star located at the center of the solar system.</li>
        <li>It has a diameter of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles) and accounts for about 99.86% of the solar system's total mass.</li>
        <li>The Sun's core is a scorching furnace where nuclear fusion reactions convert hydrogen into helium, releasing immense energy in the form of light and heat.</li>
        <li>This energy radiates outward, providing heat and light to the entire solar system, making life on Earth possible.</li>
        <li>The Sun's magnetic activity results in phenomena such as sunspots, solar flares, and the solar wind, which can affect space weather and Earth's magnetic field.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ü™êPlanets:</h2>
    <p>The solar system consists of eight recognized planets, divided into two main groups:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Terrestrial (Inner) Planets:</strong> These are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Terrestrial planets are characterized by their solid, rocky surfaces and relatively small sizes compared to gas giants. Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only one known to support life.</li>
        <li><strong>Gas Giant (Outer) Planets:</strong> These are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Gas giants are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and lack solid surfaces. They have massive atmospheres and, in some cases, spectacular ring systems. Jupiter, the largest planet, exerts a strong gravitational influence on the solar system and is known for its Great Red Spot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üåòMoons:</h2>
    <p>Planetary moons are natural satellites that orbit planets. Some planets have numerous moons, each with unique characteristics. Earth's Moon, for example, plays a significant role in Earth's tides and has been the target of human exploration.</p>

    <h2>‚òÑÔ∏èAsteroids:</h2>
    <p>Asteroids are rocky or metallic objects that primarily inhabit the asteroid belt, a region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. They vary in size from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers across. Notable asteroids include Ceres, which is also classified as a dwarf planet, and Vesta.</p>
   
    <h2>üå†Comets:</h2>
    <p>Comets are composed of ice, dust, and rocky material and follow highly elliptical orbits. As comets approach the Sun, solar radiation causes them to develop a glowing coma (a hazy envelope) and often a visible tail that points away from the Sun. Famous comets, like Halley's Comet, have been observed for centuries.</p>

    <h2>üîµDwarf Planets:</h2>
    <p>Dwarf planets are celestial bodies that orbit the Sun but have not cleared their orbits of other debris, which is one criterion for planetary status. Pluto, once considered the ninth planet, was reclassified as a dwarf planet. Other dwarf planets include Eris, Haumea, and Makemake, primarily found in the Kuiper Belt.</p>

    <h2>‚≠ïKuiper Belt and Oort Cloud:</h2>
    <p>The Kuiper Belt is a region beyond Neptune's orbit containing numerous icy objects, including dwarf planets like Pluto. The Oort Cloud is a hypothetical, much more distant region believed to contain a vast number of comets, extending far beyond the Kuiper Belt. These regions provide insight into the early solar system's formation and the origins of comets.</p>

    <h2>üöÄSpacecraft Exploration:</h2>
    <p>Robotic spacecraft, launched by space agencies worldwide, have explored and continue to explore various solar system bodies. Missions like Voyager, Cassini, Curiosity, and New Horizons have provided invaluable data about planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. Future missions aim to further our understanding of the solar system, including potential human missions to Mars.</p>

    <h2>üååDynamic and Evolving System:</h2>
    <p>The solar system is dynamic and constantly evolving. Processes such as planet formation, asteroid impacts, and the solar cycle are ongoing. Scientific research and exploration missions continually expand our knowledge of the solar system and its history. Understanding our solar system also informs our understanding of the broader universe and the conditions that support life on Earth.</p>

    <p>This detailed overview provides a comprehensive look at the solar system, highlighting its complexity, diversity of celestial objects, and ongoing scientific exploration and discovery.</p>
